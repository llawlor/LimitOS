<h4>Device Communication</h4>
<%= Rails.application.config_for(:limitos)['application_name'] %> communication occurs via secure websockets from the <%= Rails.application.config_for(:limitos)['application_name'] %> servers to and from the devices.

<h4 id="install_script">Security Note Regarding Install Scripts</h4>
Please be careful when running untrusted scripts directly from the internet using a command that executes automatically like the <%= Rails.application.config_for(:limitos)['application_name'] %> script does.
You should always audit the code to understand what it's doing first, which you can do by
<a href="/run">viewing the code directly</a>.
<br>
A <a href="/devices/pretty_print_install">nicer version</a> of the code is also available to view via your web browser.
<br><br>
The <%= Rails.application.config_for(:limitos)['application_name'] %> code is also publicly <a href="https://github.com/llawlor/LimitOS">available on GitHub</a> for viewing.
